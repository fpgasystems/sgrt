# Networking validation with iperf
In this experiment, we are using CLI’s [sgutil validate iperf](../cli/manual/sgutil-validate-mpi.md#sgutil-validate-mpi) command to actively measure the maximum achievable bandwidth on the ETHZ-HACC network.

### Prerrequisites
* You must have a valid authentication key pairs for SSH in your **~/.ssh** directory, and
* Your public key must be added to the authorized keys. 

```
$ ssh-keygen
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

If the public key **~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub** is not present, *sgutil validate iperf* will run the commands above for you automatically.

## Experiment
1. Use the [booking system](https://alveo-booking.ethz.ch/login.php) to reserve the servers you wish to validate,
2. Login to the server you want to set as the iperf server—all others will be the clients for the experiment,
3. Run ```sgutil validate iperf``` and wait for the results.

## Results
To provide a baseline, we repeated the same experiment for the different clusters (e.g., when we reserved all six machines for cluster U250) and also to verify the inter-cluster network (when we booked one server from each cluster). **Please, remember that** ```sgutil validate iperf``` **sets -P (the number of parallel client threads to run) to four.**

### U250
The following table has been derived after booking the **six** U250 servers that are available in the HACC:

![sgutil validate iperf for U250 cluster.](./sgutil-validate-iperf-U250.png "sgutil validate iperf for U250 cluster.")
*sgutil validate iperf for U250 cluster.*

### U280
The following table has been derived after booking the **four** U280 servers that are available in the HACC:

![sgutil validate iperf for U280 cluster.](./sgutil-validate-iperf-U280.png "sgutil validate iperf for U280 cluster.")
*sgutil validate iperf for U280 cluster.*

### U50D
The following table has been derived after booking the **four** U50D servers that are available in the HACC:

![sgutil validate iperf for U50D cluster.](./sgutil-validate-iperf-U50D.png "sgutil validate iperf for U50D cluster.")
*sgutil validate iperf for U50D cluster.*

### U55C
The following table has been derived after booking the **ten** U55C servers that are available in the HACC:

![sgutil validate iperf for U55C cluster.](./sgutil-validate-iperf-U55C.png "sgutil validate iperf for U250 cluster.")
*sgutil validate iperf for U55C cluster.*
